# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

It is a discipline that involves the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.
software engineering is highly portable whereas traditional programming is less portable.
software engineering is readable and close to human language whereas traditional programming is cryptic and close to machine language.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

planning-derive the project scope and objective and come up with a risk management plan.
design-create a blueprint of the objectives through system design and database design
coding-implement the executable code.
testing-ensure the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.
deployment-releasing the software for execution.
maintenance-provide ongoing support and enhancement to the software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Both are aimed to fulfil client requirements.
Both including testing phase to ensure quality of software
Both frameworks used to manage software development projects.
Both models require documentation.

Agile method is iterative and incremental whereas waterfall method is linear and sequential
Agile method is continuous whereas waterfall method is limited to initial and final stages.
Documetation in agile method is minimal and flexible whereas in waterfall method it is comprehensive and detailed.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of defining,documenting and maintaining the requirements in the engineering design process.
It entails: Elicitation ,Analysis ,Specification, Validation,Management
Importance
It brings about foundation in the development process.
It helps in reducing risk as they are identified early in the project.
It is time saving and cost efficiency.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Self modularity is dividing a software system into small units each with a specific functionality.
It helps about isolation of modules hence easy to fix.
On splitting the units its easier to understand and code.
The units can be replaced in other systems independently.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

unit testing-One identifies the correctness of individual component.
Integration testing-this entails testing the interactions between different components.
System testing-it entails testing of the complete system.
Acceptance testing-It entails whether the system is ready for the business requirements.
testing is important since it ensures the software meets the requirements of the end user and also detect defects in early stages.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control System are tools that help manage changes to source code over time.
It helps multiple developers work on the same project and compare changes before merging the code to the main branch.
Examples include Git,Mercurial

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The role of a software project manager involves coordinating and lead a project team so as to meet its goal.
Responsibilities include:
Define the project scope ,objectives and timelines for the project
Manage the project resources.
Identify risks and try to know how to mitigate them.
Challeges that are encountered include:
Time constraints.
Resource Constraints
Risk management

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance ensures that a software continues to function correctly and efficient over time.
Types of maintenance
Corrective maintenance-fix defects and bugs found in the software.
Adaptive maintenance-makes software change with the environmemnt.
preventive maintenance-prevent future issues by making the software more robust and maintenable.
Perfective maintenance-Improves performance  and maintenance of the software.

Maintenance helps with adaptability of software to change with the environment.It is also cost efefctive since it prevents major failure.It ensures the software is complaiant with the legal framework.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Collection and use of personal information without consent.
Release of a software with known defects hence compromising the user.
Failure to ensure enough security of the software nay lead to data breaches.

Ethical standards can be improved by 
continuous learning so as to be equiped with the latest technology.
Familiarize themselves with ethical guidelines and standards.
Seek diverse opinions from other people so as to help identify ethical concerns.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
